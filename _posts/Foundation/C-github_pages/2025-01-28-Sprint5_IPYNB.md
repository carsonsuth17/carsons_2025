# CPT Requirements Met by My Model and API Code

Programming is a collaborative and creative process that brings ideas to life through the development of software. In the **Create** performance task, I designed and implemented a program that manages user preferences and recommendations, allowing users to input their preferences and view personalized suggestions based on shared tastes.

### Purpose of My Group's Program
The purpose of our group program is to create a full-stack system that gathers and matches music preferences, allowing users to see personalized recommendations based on their preferences. The backend handles API requests for user preferences and uses an algorithm to find the best matches. 

- **Key Features**: 
    - Collecting and storing user music preferences.
    - Returning personalized matches based on shared preferences.
    - Allowing users to submit, edit, and delete their preferences.

### Purpose of My Individual Features
My individual features focus on creating an API for handling user music preferences and implementing a matching algorithm that suggests users with similar tastes. The API allows users to submit preferences, view their data, and interact with others in a meaningful way.

- **Key Features**: 
    - **Input/Output**: Handling input from users via API requests and returning responses in JSON format.
    - **Data Management**: Interacting with the database to store, update, and delete user preferences.
