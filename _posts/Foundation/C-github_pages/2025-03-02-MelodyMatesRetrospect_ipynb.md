## Self-Grade: **8/10**

 **5 Points:**
### **Tasks completed over 12 weeks, addressing issues, burndown progress, and presentation.**

What I think I got: 4.5/5

Reasoning: For having to redo my feature and having to work around a multitude of obstacles I think I got what was needed to be done in order for my team to be successful, finsihed. I know I could've done my backend much better than what I had done, and had more backend related accomplishments as a whole. 

 **2 Points:**
### **Full Stack Project Demo with CPT requirements and N@tM feedback highlights.**

What I think I got: .5/2

 **1 Point:**
### **Wrote a Project Feature blog using CPT/FRQ language.**

What I think I got: 1/1

Reasoning: I successfully wrote the Project Feature blog using CPT/FRQ language, clearly explaining the projectâ€™s core features, functionality, and how they align with the given requirements. My writing was detailed and focused on the key concepts, demonstrating a solid understanding of the topic.


 **1 Point:**
### **Contributed an MCQ.**

What I think I got: 1/1

Reasoning: I finsihed the MCQ and gave back a detailed report on what I need to improve on and what I believe are my strengths. 

 **9/10:**
### **The 10th point is earned by impressing through reflection, future planning, and supporting peers.**

What I think I got: 1/1

Reasoning: I've already begun thinking about what my next steps should be and how I can apply this valuable knowledge and skill into my future major and job. I showed consistent interest and encouragement into what my teammates and other peers were doing and giving help whenever they needed even if not class related. 

### In Summary

- Strong execution in UI/UX and teamwork.

- Significant efforts made in and outside of class.
