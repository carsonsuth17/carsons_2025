## Warm-up (5-10 minutes)
- **High Knees** – 2 sets of 30 seconds
- **Torso Twists** – 2 sets of 20 reps
- **Side Leg Raises** – 2 sets of 15 reps per side


## Workout


### 1. Plank
- **Sets:** 3
- **Time:** 30-60 seconds
- **Rest:** 60 seconds
- **Form Tips:** Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels, engaging your core without sagging or arching your back.


### 2. Bicycle Crunches
- **Sets:** 3
- **Reps:** 15-20 per side
- **Rest:** 60 seconds
- **Form Tips:** Twist from your core, not your neck, and focus on slow, controlled movements.


### 3. Side Plank (Alternating)
- **Sets:** 3
- **Time:** 30-45 seconds per side
- **Rest:** 60 seconds
- **Form Tips:** Stack your feet and lift your hips to engage your obliques, holding the position steady.


### 4. Russian Twists
- **Sets:** 3
- **Reps:** 20 per side
- **Rest:** 60 seconds
- **Form Tips:** Keep your core tight and twist your torso, tapping the floor beside you. Use a weight for added resistance if needed.


### 5. Leg Raises
- **Sets:** 3
- **Reps:** 12-15
- **Rest:** 60 seconds
- **Form Tips:** Keep your lower back pressed into the ground as you lift and lower your legs. This engages the lower abs and prevents strain.


### 6. Mountain Climbers
- **Sets:** 3
- **Time:** 30-45 seconds
- **Rest:** 60 seconds
- **Form Tips:** Keep your core engaged and avoid letting your hips sag. Move your knees toward your chest as fast as possible with good form.


### 7. Heel Touches
- **Sets:** 3
- **Reps:** 20 per side
- **Rest:** 60 seconds
- **Form Tips:** Keep your shoulders off the ground and reach side to side, tapping your heels to engage the obliques.


## Cool Down
- **Cobra Stretch:** 30 seconds
- **Cat-Cow Stretch:** 30 seconds
- **Side Body Stretch:** 30 seconds per side


## Tips:
- **Avoid Overloading Obliques:** Too much heavy weight on oblique exercises can build thickness, so focus on bodyweight movements to keep the waist slim.
- **Frequency:** Perform this routine 3-4 times a week for best results.
- **Progression:** Increase time under tension or reps as you get stronger, but avoid excessively heavy weights to maintain a lean, toned midsection.
