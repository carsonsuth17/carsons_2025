    "\n",
    "- Q6: A - The internet: IETF doesnt prevent malware from being distibuted online. \n",
    "- Q11: D - I selected C, which is wrong because the code segment selects \"Red\" one-sixth of the time, \"Yellow\" one-sixth of the time, and \"Blue\" the remaining two-thirds of the time.\n",
    "- Q25: B - I selected D, which is wrong because I guessed on it and the fact it could be shortened by using byte pair encoding. \n",
    "- Q31: C - I selected B, which is wrong because I guessed on it and program 1 also correctly moves the robot to the gray square by repeatedly moving the robot forward, left, and right. \n",
    "- Q33: A - I selected B, which is wrong because I guessed on it.\n",
    "- Q37: C - I selected A, because code segment 2 also displays the correct average.\n",
    "- Q43: A - I selected B, which is wrong because the number of steps of the algorithm is a polynomial, so the algorithm runs in reasonable time. \n",
    "- Q44: B - I selected C, which is wrong because the operation 10+7 causes an overflow error, while 12+3 does not produce a result large enough to cause one. \n",
    "- Q52: D - I selected B, which is wrong because option 2 does work, but so does option 3. \n",
    "- Q54: D - I selected  A, which is wrong because the add procedure doesn't generalize the square and cube procedures, which are used to calculate a power of N. \n",
    "- Q56: D - I selected A, which is wrong because the program counts ODD integers, not EVEN integers. \n",
    "- Q57: B - I selected D, this expression would return the string \"arpy\" \n",
    "- Q58: A - I selected B, the internect can provide tools, info, and knowledge to crowdsourcing participants. \n",
    "- Q59: B - I selected A, which is wrong because I guessed on it and usuing standard video format would help enure that the videos are accessible in the future. \n",
    "- Q60: A+D - I selected B+C, which would be incorrect because using the shorter variable names would not help a programmer to manage the complexity of a program. \n",
    "- Q61: A+B - I selected A+C, which is partially correct but C is wrong because east high school provides the zip code but west high school did not. \n",
    "- Q62: C+D - I selected A+B, A is incorrect because as users from around the world add content to the online encyclopedia, it may become difficult to determine whether any of the new content is copyrighted. B is incorrect because as articles can be edited by any user, an article may contain different content when it is accessed at different times.\n",
    "- Q63: B+D - C is wrong because the varible count should be incremented withing the if statement \n",
    "- Q66: C+D - B is incorrect becayse the first value smaller than the first number in the list, so the procedure returns the correct value 1 0."
